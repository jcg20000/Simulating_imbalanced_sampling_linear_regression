# Simulating_imbalanced_sampling_linear_regression
The Python code simulated a imbalanced calibration design for linear regression model. 
The simple linear regression describe the relation: sensor response=a*concentration+b.
20 calibration samples @ one concentration level, 5 calibration samples @ other levels.
Plots compare the line beween balanced and imbalanced calibration.
-Simulates noisy sensor responses for known concentrations.
-Fits two regression models: one with balanced and one with biased data.
-Plots the result to show how the biased sampling affects the regression line.
